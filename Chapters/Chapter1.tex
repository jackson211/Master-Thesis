\chapter{Introduction}

Large volumes of data have been collected and generated considerably over the recent years, among the increasing popularity of smartphones and Internet services. Multidimensional data such as geographic coordinates data and CAD data is considered as core infrastructure and component in the technology world \cite{gunther1990research, morton1966computer}. Data queries in spatial data, such as range query and k nearest neighbour query has been widely used in map based products and location based services. Google maps use range queries and KNN to find points of interest. For example, finding restaurants in a region and finding restaurants near me. In VLSI CAD, spatial data index is also used to manage two-dimensional data objects such as polylines and polygons \cite{liu1994evaluation}. In some other areas, the spatial management system is also integrated with image processing and computer vision. For example, medical images and remote sensing images use spatial databases to store and location spatial objects from the images \cite{borah2004improved, adhikary1996knowledge, mantel2004matching, tagare1997medical}. 

How to effectively manage spatial data have been studied significantly in the past few decades \cite{Gaede:1998fp, ooi1990efficient}. Spatial index methods have been developed in many different approaches. Some have derived from a one-dimensional approach, such as linear hashing \cite{larson1980linear} and extendible hashing \cite{fagin1979extendible}. Some have derived from popular one-dimensional B-Tree structure \cite{Bayer:2002ds}, such as K-D-Tree \cite{Bentley:1975gn}, Quad-Tree \cite{CSUR:tm}, R-Tree \cite{Guttman:1984ka}, and so on. All spatial indexes support two-dimensional data points, and most indexes are also capable of handling polygons or line segments. Spatial queries are also different from regular database queries, range query and KNN query is especially important, and each index has a unique way to process these query tasks. 



\section{Motivation}
A recent study on the learned index \cite{Kraska:2017vh} demonstrates that a learned cumulative distribution function (CDF) from a data distribution can predict the position of the key, and invented the Recursive Model Index (RMI). Traditional data indexes follow certain policies to store data in the data structure, and they have to consider all data distribution. There are several advantages to a learned index. Firstly, the learned CDF could potentially reduce the search time complexity, especially in some cases where the CDF curve is perfectly fitted according to the dataset. Secondly, the memory size for a learned model is much smaller than the traditional data structure. For example, B-Tree stores data items in the nodes, the size of a data item must be taken into the memory size, whereas a learned B-Tree model is trying to find the page that contains the query item. The memory size of a learned model contains few parameters. Thirdly, a learned neural network can utilize the SIMD capabilities of CPU and GPU, and this can be a significant advantage on a large scale dataset \cite{patterson2016computer}. All the advantages of the learned model open up a new field in databases, the power behind the learned function that describe the data distribution can be applied to many other data structures and algorithms, and potentially make the traditional data structures and algorithms more efficient. 

Furthermore, the one-dimensional learned index can be expanded to handle two-dimensional data. ZM index \cite{Wang:2019ks} uses the Z-order curve to connect two-dimensional data points in space transformed into one-dimensional data, then it is easy to apply the learned index model upon the one-dimensional data. The Flood \cite{Nathan:2019wc} uses a grid layout partitioning the space into different cells, then during the querying phase, the search window looks for intersecting cells, then refine and filter the query result from the cells. The RSMI \cite{Qi:2020uz} combines ideas from RMI, Z-order curve and R-Tree, and it uses Z-order numbering each partitioning block, then uses RMI to predict the corresponding block id. There are many more learned spatial indexes that integrate the traditional method with ideas from the learned index. All the learned spatial indexes have shown some performance gain or memory size reduction that benefits from the learned model. Therefore, introducing the learned model in the traditional spatial data index can further improve the efficiency of the spatial data management system. 



\section{Research Questions}
There are two primary aims of this proposed research: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Investigating the existing spatial indexes, the learned indexes and novel learned spatial indexes.
\item To apply the learned model technique based on existing knowledge about data indexes. 
\end{itemize}

The success achieved in the one-dimensional data index raises a question if we are reasoning about a similar task on multidimensional data: how can we improve the efficiency of a spatial data index through learned models? Specifically, can we improve the performance of the index by reducing the query lookup speed; or reducing the memory consumption; and comparison with some existing approaches to the learned spatial index, can we do better or worse than those methods?
