\chapter{Introduction}
Spatial data has grown considerably over the recent years, with increasing popularity of smartphones and Internet services. Multidimensional data such as spatial data and image data is considered as a core infrastructure and component in the technology world. Motivation of organizing and accessing spatial data is driven by fields in geological information systems, 3D printing, and Internet of Things(IoT) devices that collect massive amounts of data. At the same time, considerable efforts have been devoted to machine learning and deep learning. Deep neural networks have been applied to solving computer vision and natural language processing tasks such as image classification\cite{he2016deep} and text prediction\cite{graves2013speech} successfully. The training data in image task and language task are both represented in some distributed vector format, which can be viewed as multidimensional data.
